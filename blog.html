			Welcome to LARA
		</h2>

		<p>
			The Luxury and Retail Association (<a href="about.html">LARA</a>) is proud to announce that it will be launching in January 2015 at New York University's undergraduate Leonard N. Stern School of Business. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Headed by a team of Seniors and Juniors at NYU, LARA was founded with the purpose of informing, inspiring, and connecting students who are interested in exploring the luxury industry. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Association welcomes not only students who are pursuing careers with prestige brands, but also individuals with a general interest in the luxury universe. In addition to driving and enhancing the luxury discussion between NYU students, faculty, and industry experts, LARA will host a speaker series and provide professional development opportunities in a broad range of luxury sectors - from high jewelry to hospitality - and retail business functions - from operations to social media - over the course of the spring semester.
		</p>
		<p>
			We invite you to join us on our journey to explore the luxury industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Warmly,
			Eleanor Lin (President) and Catharina Kronlein (Vice President)
		</p>
