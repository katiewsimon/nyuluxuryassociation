				My Internship at: Ralph Lauren
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Matilde Wergeland
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Ralph Lauren, Australia
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Sales Assistant
		</p>

		<p>
			Working as a sales assistant for Ralph Lauren in Sydney, Australia was definitely one of the best jobs I have ever had. I have always been a huge fan of the brand- not only the amazing apparel, but also the lifestyle that Ralph Lauren has created. I also think that his career, life, and accomplishments are incredibly inspirational and motivational. 
		</p>

		<p>
			As a sales assistant, my main duties included greeting customers and selling our products. Our store had many regular customers, but it was also a popular destination for tourists. Managers from Australia's head office often visited the store, and I really appreciated how they established a close relationship between sales assistants and senior-level people at the company. In addition to after-work and Christmas parties, I was invited to a special training program for one weekend. Even four years later, I still keep in touch with many of my former colleagues! This job made me realize that I would like to go back to Australia one day-hopefully working in Marketing and for Ralph Lauren.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most Interesting Experience</strong>: I met so many fascinating customers there-locals, tourists, thieves (yes, that's right!), and celebrities. Once, I sold merchandise worth of over 4,000 AUS dollars to an Australian couple, and they paid in cash... Two other sales assistants had to help me count all the bills and make sure that the couple got all the clothes and shoes that they had bought. It took us over two hours to complete the sale.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most Valuable Experience</strong>: When I started, I had a boss who created a very stressful work environment, but he was replaced with another manager who transformed the whole ambiance and mood in the store. The new manager really motivated us to work hard. We all started to enjoy our jobs a lot, and that really showed: our store became one of the best selling stores in not only Sydney, but also the whole country. This experience really taught me the importance of having and being a good manager and leader. Creating a friendly, open, and motivational environment is the most effective way to gain respect from your employees and to reach your goals.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite Part of Your Job</strong>: I love traveling and meeting new people, and I am also very interested in languages. Hence, I loved having the opportunity to interact with so many different people from all over the world when they visited our store. I remember many of the customers that I met, and I really enjoyed talking to them, hearing their stories, and being able to help them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of Advice</strong>: When I first started, my experience in the retail industry was limited. However, I knew that even though I might not be a very experienced sales assistant, I was a very experienced shopper. You should always tried to put yourself in the customers' shoes and ask yourself how you, as a customer, would want to be treated when you enter a store. One thing that I did was that I decided to always be polite to everyone-whether it's a little kid or Hugh Jackman. You never know who your customer is, so it's important to treat everybody equally. Make sure that all of your customers and colleagues to know that you hear, see, and remember them. Follow up on things, and show that you work hard in order to help them.

				My Internship at: Richemont
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Vince N.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Richemont
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Marketing & Communications Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			Richemont is a massive luxury goods holding group with many high-end brands, but I worked specifically with a luxury watch brand.  During my six months there, I helped manage three distinct workflows in their marketing and communications operations: (1) Trade marketing, (2) Advertising, PR, and internal communications, and (3) Events and sponsorships. Even three years later, I still view this internship as my breadth and depth marketing experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: I helped plan and staff the brand's booth at Travel & Leisure's annual Global Bazaar.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Having such a broad range of tasks, I could really determine what I did and didn't like doing. Also, deciding when it's time to leave when the learning has stopped.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The people I worked with were warm and friendly. Slow days went faster, and fast days passed too quickly.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Don't be afraid to push back. You may be the intern, but what you lack in experience, you make up for in fresh perspective.

				My Internship at: Prada
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Natasha Patel
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Prada USA Corp
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Human Resources Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			I spent my summer interning at Prada USA Corp, and it was an incredible experience. Since I have always been interested in fashion, seeing, working with and understanding the corporate side of the industry really gave me a new perspective. My role itself entailed coordinating interviews, scheduling meetings, sourcing employees for both retail and corporate positions across the country, and communicating with Prada's offices around the world. Every department within the corporate office is closely linked since it is a small company, so I gained some experience within PR and Finance as well. I could definitely see my own progress within my role since I went from shadowing my boss the first day to sourcing, coordinating and participating in interviews by my last day. I gained a deeper understanding of recruiting as well as insight on the culture of the company.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: While I was interning, Prada had their male fashion show. This was an incredible show to watch. Witnessing the final results was amazing, and the experience really highlighted the importance of each corporate puzzle piece for putting together a fashion show.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Since HR was such a small  team at Prada, I received a lot of guidance; each member of the team put aside time to teach me something within their division on a daily basis. I truly felt that I learned a lot since I got a holistic view of Human Resources and Prada USA itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: My favorite part of the day was probably lunch because Prada has a huge canteen on the top floor. People-watching there was so inspiring since everyone has such a unique and fashionable style.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Take into consideration the company you are working at. Prada has a very conservative, strict, Italian culture, so some culture conflicts can arise. However, the strong culture was definitely something I loved since it made me feel even more connected to the headquarters in Milan.

				My Internship at: Birchbox
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Devin McNulty
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Birchbox
		</p>

		<p>
			I currently work at Birchbox, a subscription-based beauty e-commerce site.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: It's all about the customers. I mainly deal with customer service via e-mail, and their responses range from appreciative to downright absurd. Some people write in with fully-fledged impassioned rants about their dissatisfaction, but with one response they'll be singing our praises again. Seeing the impact one or two e-mails can have on a customer is absolutely fascinating. I have one customer who demands to only speak with me (rather than anyone else on the team) simply because I said "Have a good weekend!" at the end of a long e-mail chain.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: This position has taught me how to speak to customers. In my department, we spend a quite some time workshopping "the Birchbox voice." This process has forced me to look at my professional interactions and challenged me to develop a smarter style. When I speak with a customer, each word impacts their opinion of the company. While we've been working on "the Birchbox voice", the rest of my business-related interpersonal correspondences have reaped the benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The community. Everyone I've interacted with, from the mailroom staff right up to our co-founders, has greeted me with a smile. Our in-house interactions all stem from a place of light-heartedness and humor. It's impossible NOT to have fun. Being part of a company on the rise is amazing to watch, and you can feel that energy as soon as you walk into our office. Plus, you get tons of free beauty products!

				My Internship at: Mercedes
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Feei-Ching (Faye) Chou
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Mercedes-Benz USA
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Product and Technology Communications Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			Part of Daimler AG and headquartered in Montvale, New Jersey, Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) is responsible for the distribution and marketing of Mercedes-Benz products in the United States.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the only intern in the MBUSA Communications department, which consists of less than 15 employees, I work primarily with the Product and Technology team. We focus on our relationships with the journalists from major automobile publications by providing them with the most up-to-date information on all of our 14 models currently marketed in the US. My team achieves this by creating up-to-date press kits and by inviting journalists to press events around the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the course of my internship, I have worked with Product Managers to update press kit materials and to collaborate with major PR/Marketing firms and Daimler headquarters in Germany to plan out all of our press events. There is a lot of emphasis on details, from choosing venue spaces, hotels, restaurants to paying attention to our attending journalists' dietary restrictions.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: My entire internship has been extremely interesting to date, but the best experience was when I got to sit in on a one-on-one interview with Jonathan S. Geller from Boy Genius Report (BGR) inside of an S63 AMG with my manager and a Product Manager in charge of the S-Class. Needless to say, it was an amazing experience and at the end of it, I even got to drive a S63 AMG!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The company culture and the people! It's great working at a company where people are so down-to-earth and welcoming. Everybody is so committed to their work, and we all feel the same sense of pride in being part of MBUSA. Our teams hold weekly meetings to connect, and from time to time we hold festivities to celebrate our accomplishments! My managers never hover or micro-manage but have confidence in my ability to get tasks/projects completed. There isn't a day when I don't feel like showing up for work. In fact, sometimes I wish I could skip class and go to work instead!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. It's the best way to learn something new, spice up your time at your internship and also show your managers that you can be flexible and are willing to learn. If you see something interesting, and you're curious, ask questions! Work hard and make yourself indispensable to the team.

				My Internship at: NARS Cosmetics
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Emily Williams
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: NARS Cosmetics
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Packaging Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			As a Packaging Intern at NARS Cosmetics, I spent my semester corresponding with vendors of cosmetic supplies to receive quotes for packaging materials, and I compiled analyses of the prices, qualities, and quantities for each quote. It was also exciting to have the opportunity to research materials for a whole new soft-touch finish material that NARS could use in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: I enjoyed touring the NARS production plant in Rutherford, New Jersey. I also communicated with vendors from Japan.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Surprisingly, I improved my pivot table and Excel skills. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: Free products was a great perk! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Be practical, but don't put yourself in a box. Being from Stern and having done finance internships for two summers, I was not exactly set up to get to get a position at a cosmetics company! Most people view Stern finance majors as the stereotypical number-crunching type, but I was determined to explore my love for cosmetics. Even though I didn't have a degree from FIT or Parsons like most other NARS interns, I was able to demonstrate my interest during the phone interview, and my diligence and boldness paid off. Don't let the Stern stereotype prevent you from exploring new industries and having one of the best experiences of going to college in NYC!

				My Internship at: Sailormade
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Florencia Gilardoni
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Sailormade
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Wholesale and Retail Fulfillment
		</p>

		<p>
			Sailormade is a nautical-themed accessories company that sells bracelets and belts for men and women through an online retail store or independent retailers all over the country. Its most popular product is a bracelet that consists of a very small version of brummels used in sailing boats and rope.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although my "job description" is to handle all product orders, retail and wholesale, I have a lot of different roles in the company. Because of its small size, I have many responsibilities that I wouldn't have elsewhere. I am part of product development meetings, I have produced photoshoots and editorial campaigns, done marketing analysis, and more. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: The first time I ever had to help with the production process I had to go to our manufacturer and give him a specific set of instructions. I showed up to the building on Eighth Avenue expecting just a normal office (looking back, my expectations were a little unrealistic...) and when the elevators door opened there was a full-scale factory on the floor of a building in the middle of Manhattan! I was so shocked. We walk by all kinds of buildings every day and I'm willing to bet that not one person thinks there is a factory inside one of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: I would say the best thing I learned on the job is to speak my mind. My opinion <em>is</em> valued in the company, and will be wherever else I go, and I should not be afraid to let it be heard.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The people! I've had several other jobs and internships in the fashion industry and the people can tend to be superficial and dry. I have such a good time every day at the office that even small tedious tasks, such as doing quality control on the brummels, goes by super fast.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Work hard and always do a good job. I started off as an intern two semesters ago and I was asked back this semester with a part-time position and now I'm being promoted! This would have never happened if I didn't treat every little task just as important as the next. Everything matters!

		<h2>
			My Internship at: Balenciaga
		</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Anna Ko
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Balenciaga (Asia Pacific); Balenciaga (America)	
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Merchandising Intern, Store Operations Intern, Retail Buying and Planning Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			My experience at Balenciaga was very comprehensive. With the Hong Kong Merchandising team and the New York Buying team, much of the work involved preparing product training materials for store employees and producing sell-through reports periodically. Merchandising or Buying involves everything that has to do with the product itself. Store Operations is a completely different department - it is the hands and legs of retail - but what makes a relatively small company like Balenciaga interesting is that each department is closely linked, all working together to achieve the company's goals. The head of retail in Hong Kong likes to say that working in store operations is like raising children: most of the work has to do with the stores and employees, making sure that they are working as a team to achieve sales targets and that they have everything they need in order to excel. Compared to my Merchandising experience, everyday work in Operations felt more hands-on; I ordered stationary for the stores, planned family and friends sale events, processed product repair requests, bought champagne and soda for the stores, and also helped with writing the operations manual.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: When I was with the Hong Kong team, I was lucky to be there for the opening of a new store. During the opening ceremony, the head of retail operations insisted on cutting a roasted pig in front of the gods for good luck, and everyone was given a red envelope (a culture-specific custom). The pork was delicious!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Working in a small team of less than twenty people really gave me a holistic perspective of the company. Every day I got to see each department interacting with one and another under the supervision of the President of the region. Balenciaga truly is an exciting brand that has a clear vision of where it wants to go and how it wants to expand in the future. There is much to learn working at a company with a heritage that is also trying new things.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: Honestly, the best feeling is when you see a person carrying a Balenciaga bag or wearing a pair of Arena sneakers on the street and think, "I helped to bring that to him/her."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: I have two pieces of advice. First, never think that you're "too good" for the job. Luxury fashion is a fascinating industry. Even if you are working on product training all day or counting mannequins, there is always much to be learned. Also, work for a brand that you like! You need to love the product, because you will be working with it all day.
