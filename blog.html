			Balenciaga
		</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Anna Ko
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Balenciaga (Asia Pacific); Balenciaga (America)	
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Merchandising Intern, Store Operations Intern, Retail Buying and Planning Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			My experience at Balenciaga was very comprehensive. With the Hong Kong Merchandising team and the New York Buying team, much of the work involved preparing product training materials for store employees and producing sell-through reports periodically. Merchandising or Buying involves everything that has to do with the product itself. Store Operations is a completely different department - it is the hands and legs of retail - but what makes a relatively small company like Balenciaga interesting is that each department is closely linked, all working together to achieve the company's goals. The head of retail in Hong Kong likes to say that working in store operations is like raising children: most of the work has to do with the stores and employees, making sure that they are working as a team to achieve sales targets and that they have everything they need in order to excel. Compared to my Merchandising experience, everyday work in Operations felt more hands-on; I ordered stationary for the stores, planned family and friends sale events, processed product repair requests, bought champagne and soda for the stores, and also helped with writing the operations manual.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: When I was with the Hong Kong team, I was lucky to be there for the opening of a new store. During the opening ceremony, the head of retail operations insisted on cutting a roasted pig in front of the gods for good luck, and everyone was given a red envelope (a culture-specific custom). The pork was delicious!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Working in a small team of less than twenty people really gave me a holistic perspective of the company. Every day I got to see each department interacting with one and another under the supervision of the President of the region. Balenciaga truly is an exciting brand that has a clear vision of where it wants to go and how it wants to expand in the future. There is much to learn working at a company with a heritage that is also trying new things.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: Honestly, the best feeling is when you see a person carrying a Balenciaga bag or wearing a pair of Arena sneakers on the street and think, "I helped to bring that to him/her."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: I have two pieces of advice. First, never think that you're "too good" for the job. Luxury fashion is a fascinating industry. Even if you are working on product training all day or counting mannequins, there is always much to be learned. Also, work for a brand that you like! You need to love the product, because you will be working with it all day.

		<h2>
			Welcome to LARA
		</h2>

		<p>
			The Luxury and Retail Association (<a href="about.html">LARA</a>) is proud to announce that it will be launching in January 2015 at New York University's undergraduate Leonard N. Stern School of Business. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Headed by a team of Seniors and Juniors at NYU, LARA was founded with the purpose of informing, inspiring, and connecting students who are interested in exploring the luxury industry. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The Association welcomes not only students who are pursuing careers with prestige brands, but also individuals with a general interest in the luxury universe. In addition to driving and enhancing the luxury discussion between NYU students, faculty, and industry experts, LARA will host a speaker series and provide professional development opportunities in a broad range of luxury sectors - from high jewelry to hospitality - and retail business functions - from operations to social media - over the course of the spring semester.
		</p>

		<p>
			We invite you to join us on our journey to explore the luxury industry.
		</p>

		<p>
			Warmly,
			Eleanor Lin (President) and Catharina Kronlein (Vice President)
		</p>
