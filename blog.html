				My Internship at: Birchbox
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Devin McNulty
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Birchbox
		</p>

		<p>
			I currently work at Birchbox, a subscription-based beauty e-commerce site.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: It's all about the customers. I mainly deal with customer service via e-mail, and their responses range from appreciative to downright absurd. Some people write in with fully-fledged impassioned rants about their dissatisfaction, but with one response they'll be singing our praises again. Seeing the impact one or two e-mails can have on a customer is absolutely fascinating. I have one customer who demands to only speak with me (rather than anyone else on the team) simply because I said "Have a good weekend!" at the end of a long e-mail chain.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: This position has taught me how to speak to customers. In my department, we spend a quite some time workshopping "the Birchbox voice." This process has forced me to look at my professional interactions and challenged me to develop a smarter style. When I speak with a customer, each word impacts their opinion of the company. While we've been working on "the Birchbox voice", the rest of my business-related interpersonal correspondences have reaped the benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The community. Everyone I've interacted with, from the mailroom staff right up to our co-founders, has greeted me with a smile. Our in-house interactions all stem from a place of light-heartedness and humor. It's impossible NOT to have fun. Being part of a company on the rise is amazing to watch, and you can feel that energy as soon as you walk into our office. Plus, you get tons of free beauty products!

				My Internship at: Mercedes
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Feei-Ching (Faye) Chou
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Mercedes-Benz USA
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Product and Technology Communications Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			Part of Daimler AG and headquartered in Montvale, New Jersey, Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) is responsible for the distribution and marketing of Mercedes-Benz products in the United States.
		</p>

		<p>
			As the only intern in the MBUSA Communications department, which consists of less than 15 employees, I work primarily with the Product and Technology team. We focus on our relationships with the journalists from major automobile publications by providing them with the most up-to-date information on all of our 14 models currently marketed in the US. My team achieves this by creating up-to-date press kits and by inviting journalists to press events around the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the course of my internship, I have worked with Product Managers to update press kit materials and to collaborate with major PR/Marketing firms and Daimler headquarters in Germany to plan out all of our press events. There is a lot of emphasis on details, from choosing venue spaces, hotels, restaurants to paying attention to our attending journalists' dietary restrictions.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: My entire internship has been extremely interesting to date, but the best experience was when I got to sit in on a one-on-one interview with Jonathan S. Geller from Boy Genius Report (BGR) inside of an S63 AMG with my manager and a Product Manager in charge of the S-Class. Needless to say, it was an amazing experience and at the end of it, I even got to drive a S63 AMG!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The company culture and the people! It's great working at a company where people are so down-to-earth and welcoming. Everybody is so committed to their work, and we all feel the same sense of pride in being part of MBUSA. Our teams hold weekly meetings to connect, and from time to time we hold festivities to celebrate our accomplishments! My managers never hover or micro-manage but have confidence in my ability to get tasks/projects completed. There isn't a day when I don't feel like showing up for work. In fact, sometimes I wish I could skip class and go to work instead!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. It's the best way to learn something new, spice up your time at your internship and also show your managers that you can be flexible and are willing to learn. If you see something interesting, and you're curious, ask questions! Work hard and make yourself indispensable to the team.

				My Internship at: NARS Cosmetics
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Emily Williams
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: NARS Cosmetics
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Packaging Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			As a Packaging Intern at NARS Cosmetics, I spent my semester corresponding with vendors of cosmetic supplies to receive quotes for packaging materials, and I compiled analyses of the prices, qualities, and quantities for each quote. It was also exciting to have the opportunity to research materials for a whole new soft-touch finish material that NARS could use in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: I enjoyed touring the NARS production plant in Rutherford, New Jersey. I also communicated with vendors from Japan.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Surprisingly, I improved my pivot table and Excel skills. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: Free products was a great perk! 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Be practical, but don't put yourself in a box. Being from Stern and having done finance internships for two summers, I was not exactly set up to get to get a position at a cosmetics company! Most people view Stern finance majors as the stereotypical number-crunching type, but I was determined to explore my love for cosmetics. Even though I didn't have a degree from FIT or Parsons like most other NARS interns, I was able to demonstrate my interest during the phone interview, and my diligence and boldness paid off. Don't let the Stern stereotype prevent you from exploring new industries and having one of the best experiences of going to college in NYC!

				My Internship at: Sailormade
			</h2>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Florencia Gilardoni
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Sailormade
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Wholesale and Retail Fulfillment
		</p>

		<p>
			Sailormade is a nautical-themed accessories company that sells bracelets and belts for men and women through an online retail store or independent retailers all over the country. Its most popular product is a bracelet that consists of a very small version of brummels used in sailing boats and rope.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although my "job description" is to handle all product orders, retail and wholesale, I have a lot of different roles in the company. Because of its small size, I have many responsibilities that I wouldn't have elsewhere. I am part of product development meetings, I have produced photoshoots and editorial campaigns, done marketing analysis, and more. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: The first time I ever had to help with the production process I had to go to our manufacturer and give him a specific set of instructions. I showed up to the building on Eighth Avenue expecting just a normal office (looking back, my expectations were a little unrealistic...) and when the elevators door opened there was a full-scale factory on the floor of a building in the middle of Manhattan! I was so shocked. We walk by all kinds of buildings every day and I'm willing to bet that not one person thinks there is a factory inside one of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: I would say the best thing I learned on the job is to speak my mind. My opinion <em>is</em> valued in the company, and will be wherever else I go, and I should not be afraid to let it be heard.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: The people! I've had several other jobs and internships in the fashion industry and the people can tend to be superficial and dry. I have such a good time every day at the office that even small tedious tasks, such as doing quality control on the brummels, goes by super fast.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: Work hard and always do a good job. I started off as an intern two semesters ago and I was asked back this semester with a part-time position and now I'm being promoted! This would have never happened if I didn't treat every little task just as important as the next. Everything matters!

		<h2>
			My Internship at: Balenciaga
		</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Guest Blogger</strong>: Anna Ko
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Company</strong>: Balenciaga (Asia Pacific); Balenciaga (America)	
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Position</strong>: Merchandising Intern, Store Operations Intern, Retail Buying and Planning Intern
		</p>

		<p>
			My experience at Balenciaga was very comprehensive. With the Hong Kong Merchandising team and the New York Buying team, much of the work involved preparing product training materials for store employees and producing sell-through reports periodically. Merchandising or Buying involves everything that has to do with the product itself. Store Operations is a completely different department - it is the hands and legs of retail - but what makes a relatively small company like Balenciaga interesting is that each department is closely linked, all working together to achieve the company's goals. The head of retail in Hong Kong likes to say that working in store operations is like raising children: most of the work has to do with the stores and employees, making sure that they are working as a team to achieve sales targets and that they have everything they need in order to excel. Compared to my Merchandising experience, everyday work in Operations felt more hands-on; I ordered stationary for the stores, planned family and friends sale events, processed product repair requests, bought champagne and soda for the stores, and also helped with writing the operations manual.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most interesting experience</strong>: When I was with the Hong Kong team, I was lucky to be there for the opening of a new store. During the opening ceremony, the head of retail operations insisted on cutting a roasted pig in front of the gods for good luck, and everyone was given a red envelope (a culture-specific custom). The pork was delicious!
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Most valuable experience</strong>: Working in a small team of less than twenty people really gave me a holistic perspective of the company. Every day I got to see each department interacting with one and another under the supervision of the President of the region. Balenciaga truly is an exciting brand that has a clear vision of where it wants to go and how it wants to expand in the future. There is much to learn working at a company with a heritage that is also trying new things.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Favorite part of your job</strong>: Honestly, the best feeling is when you see a person carrying a Balenciaga bag or wearing a pair of Arena sneakers on the street and think, "I helped to bring that to him/her."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Piece of advice</strong>: I have two pieces of advice. First, never think that you're "too good" for the job. Luxury fashion is a fascinating industry. Even if you are working on product training all day or counting mannequins, there is always much to be learned. Also, work for a brand that you like! You need to love the product, because you will be working with it all day.
