		<h2>
			Product Feature: Wearable Technology - The Future of Fashion
		</h2>

		<p>
			Arguably one of the best parts about working in the fashion and luxury space is the fast-paced "trend" nature of the industry. The advancement of technology coupled with rapidly changing styles creates a new wave of luxury fashion-wearable technology. While your smartphone may be your most important accessory right now, there will be a time in the not-so-distant future (i.e. right now) when your glasses, watches, and even jewelry can use electronic enhancements to take the user experience to new heights. Let's break down a new player in the wearable tech arena that has the optential to save lives with just a click of a pendant.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Who</strong>: Sense6 Design, a San Francisco based start-up combining jewelry and personal safety
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>What</strong>: Artemis Jewelry
		</p>

		<p>
			This line of fashion jewelry combines modern jewelry designs with high-tech safety features that allow wearers to call for help in the case of a medical emergency or assault. The wearer simply needs to press a button on their jewelry piece quickly three times to connect to an operator who will then have access to anything the wearer says, and his or her location. The operator can then direct a request for fire, medical, or police personnel to the wearer's location. Sense6 argues that calling for help in an emergency situation with a regular cell phone can prompt an attacker to become more violent, and the process can take up to a minute, especially if the phone is in a purse or bag. With an Artmes necklace or bracelet, victims can contact professional help (and up to 3 friends or family members) quickly, increasing the chances for a quick rescue.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>When</strong>: Artemis Jewelry is still in its development stage. You can help fund Sense6 at the following link and receive a product with estimated delivery in December 2015.

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Where</strong>: As of now, Artemis will work across the US and with limited functionality abroad. Eventually, Sense6 hopes for the jewelry to be completely usable internationally.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Why</strong>: Fashion may be your life, but now it can also save your life. Here at LARA we think this jewelry line is taking an innovative technology-driven approach that will definitely be useful, especially to the modern woman. Some may argue that this technology could have the ability to be misused, and result in a breach of privacy. However, we personally feel that Artemis will do more good than harm, and is a fashion product to watch out for in 2015.
